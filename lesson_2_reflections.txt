1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It creates the hidden .git directory, which allows you to use all the git commands. You need git installed.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area shows what files will be altered in the next commit. This allows you to make a small logical save
	when you're possibly working on multiple other files simultaneously.
