1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    If you're collaborating with others. It also serves as a backup for your code.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	If you're working on an experimental feature that could conflict with new commits. 

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forking clones a repository on github that you can administrate. Cloning makes a copy of a repository locally from 
	either a local or remote source. Branches are collections of connected commits. 

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	Git status can tell us how far we've progressed from the last pull.
